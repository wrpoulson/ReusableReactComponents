smallest building block of an app and foundation of a component library

wrap html primitives?
	unique element id
	placeholder values / default values
	enforce layout
	easily implement error messaging
	touched dirty meta data

	Think about these better names for inputs
		TextInput, Checkbox, Dropdown, RadioList, PickOneFromList (for radio or select list flexible)

match props name to the html attribute they map to for easy understanding

dont suffix arrays for no reason, users > userList

SPREAD operator
	{...this.props}
	definitely read more
	can be used with destructuring to pass certain props but not others to children

formatting components
	<cash>6</cash> => $6.00
	<cash showDecimal={false}>6</cash> => $6.00
